# Python CLI Tool for Generating MCP Servers from API Specs

## Introduction  
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is an open standard for connecting AI systems with data sources in a secure, standardized way ([Introducing the Model Context Protocol \ Anthropic](https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol#:~:text=The%20Model%20Context%20Protocol%20is,that%20connect%20to%20these%20servers)). This Python-based CLI tool automates the creation of an MCP server from a given API specification. By parsing an OpenAPI or GraphQL specification, it generates a fully functional MCP server project that adheres to Anthropic's best practices and integrates with the official MCP SDK. This allows developers to quickly expose their data or services through an MCP server, bridging the gap between AI assistants and real-world data sources.

## Inputs  
The tool accepts two main inputs:  

- **API Specification File (OpenAPI or GraphQL):** Provided in YAML or JSON (for OpenAPI) or SDL/IDL schema (for GraphQL). The tool automatically detects the spec type by examining the file content or extension. For example, presence of an `"openapi"` field indicates OpenAPI, whereas a schema starting with `schema {` or `type Query` suggests GraphQL. Robust validation ensures the spec is well-formed; otherwise, clear errors are reported.  
- **JSON Configuration File:** Defines generation options and guidelines, including:  
  - **Output Language:** One of Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, or Rust. The tool leverages the official MCP SDKs for these languages ([Model Context Protocol · GitHub](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol#:~:text=,64)) to ensure compatibility.  
  - **Privacy Handling:** Strategies like field redaction, anonymization, and data minimization. For example, you can specify fields to redact or enable an anonymization filter.  
  - **Authentication Method:** Supports OAuth 2.0 or API Keys. The tool will scaffold middleware hooks for the chosen auth scheme (e.g. OAuth token verification or API key checking) with TODOs for custom logic.  
  - **Security Measures:** Toggles for features such as rate limiting, secure HTTP headers (e.g. HSTS, CSP), and compliance settings (for standards like GDPR or internal security policies).  

Example **config.json** snippet:  
```json
{
  "language": "Python",
  "privacy": {
    "redact_fields": ["password", "ssn"],
    "anonymize": true,
    "data_minimization": true
  },
  "authentication": "apiKey",
  "security": {
    "rate_limit": true,
    "secure_headers": true,
    "compliance": "GDPR"
  }
}
```  

## Functionality Overview  
The CLI tool performs several steps to generate the MCP server project, ensuring modularity and maintainability at each stage:

### 1. Parsing (Standardizing the API Spec)  
The first step is parsing and standardizing the API specification. The tool reads the spec file (YAML or JSON for OpenAPI, or `.graphql`/IDL for GraphQL) and converts it into a unified internal representation. This involves:  

- **Spec Type Detection:** Based on file extension or content markers, the tool decides whether it's dealing with OpenAPI or GraphQL. For OpenAPI, the root keys like `"openapi"` or `"swagger"` will be present; for GraphQL, it might detect schema definition language syntax.  
- **OpenAPI Parsing:** Using a YAML/JSON parser (like Python’s `yaml` or `json` module), the tool loads the OpenAPI spec. It then iterates through the spec’s paths and methods to capture endpoint definitions (paths, HTTP methods, parameters, request/response schemas, and operationIds or descriptions). All this is transformed into a list of endpoint objects in a language-agnostic format (e.g. a list of `EndpointSpec` data classes). This internal format might include fields such as `name`, `path` (or GraphQL field), `method` (for REST), input schema, output schema, and any description or summary.  
- **GraphQL Parsing:** If a GraphQL schema is provided, the tool can use a GraphQL library or simple parsing heuristics to identify **Query** and **Mutation** types. It extracts the field names, arguments, and return types from the schema. Each GraphQL field (query or mutation) is mapped to a similar `EndpointSpec` object (with perhaps a pseudo-path like the field name and an indication that it’s a GraphQL resolver). For example, a GraphQL query `getUser(id: ID): User` would be captured with name `getUser`, parameters `id: ID`, and output type `User`.  
- **Standardization:** Regardless of spec format, the output is a standardized collection of endpoint definitions that the rest of the tool can work with uniformly. This abstraction allows the code generation logic to be written once per target language, without worrying about whether the input was OpenAPI or GraphQL.  

All parsing steps include robust error handling. If the file is missing, not parseable, or violates expected schema (e.g. an OpenAPI with no `paths` or a GraphQL schema missing a `Query` type), the tool will print clear error messages and exit gracefully. It uses Python exceptions to catch issues and provides feedback (for instance, “Error: Invalid OpenAPI file - missing 'paths' section”). This ensures the user can correct any problems before generation proceeds.

### 2. Transformation (Spec to MCP Server Code)  
After parsing, the tool transforms the internal representation into an MCP server project in the chosen language. This is the core generation step where we produce source code files and configuration files. Key aspects of this phase:  

- **Template-Based Code Generation:** To maintain clean and consistent output, the tool uses code templates for each supported language. These templates encapsulate the boilerplate needed to set up an MCP server (using the official SDK for that language) and placeholders for the specific endpoints/resources from the spec. By using templates (e.g. Jinja2 in Python), we ensure the output code is well-formatted and follows language conventions (PEP8 for Python, typical style for TypeScript, etc.).  
- **Using Official MCP SDKs:** The generated server code will import and use Anthropic's MCP SDK for the given language (e.g. `modelcontextprotocol` Python package, or the `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` in TypeScript). This provides base classes and functions to handle MCP connections. By building on the official SDK, the generated server aligns with the standard protocol implementation and benefits from the SDK's utilities ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,SDK%20for%20the%20server%20project)). For example, in Python the template might import `mcp` (the SDK) and subclass an `MCPServer` class or register resources using the SDK’s decorators. In TypeScript, it might create an Express app or use the provided framework in the MCP TS SDK.  
- **Endpoint Stubs:** For each endpoint or GraphQL field from the spec, the tool generates a handler function or method in the server code. In a REST (OpenAPI) context, this could be an HTTP route; in GraphQL, a resolver function. The generator uses the spec information to name the function and include parameters. For instance, an OpenAPI path `/users [GET]` might generate a Python method `def get_users(self, request): ...` or a TypeScript route handler for GET `/users`. Each stub includes a docstring or comment with details from the spec (e.g. description, expected input/output) and a `TODO` note for the developer to implement actual logic (like fetching from a database). The stub will typically return a placeholder response or raise a `NotImplementedError`.  
- **Language-Specific Project Structure:** The transformation accounts for the idiomatic project structure of the target language:  
  - **Python:** Creates a package directory (e.g. `my_server/` with `__init__.py`) and a `server.py` (or `app.py`) containing the server implementation. We adhere to Python packaging standards and MCP server patterns ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,start%20building%20an%20MCP%20server)), ensuring the output can be installed or run easily (possibly including a `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` if needed, and a `requirements.txt` listing dependencies like `modelcontextprotocol` SDK and any web framework used).  
  - **TypeScript:** Generates a Node.js project (with `package.json`) including dependencies such as the MCP TypeScript SDK and common middleware packages. The source (under `src/`) might include an `index.ts` or `server.ts` that instantiates an Express (or similar) server and sets up routes or resources. A `tsconfig.json` is provided for compilation.  
  - **Kotlin:** Creates a Gradle project (with `build.gradle.kts` or Maven `pom.xml`) depending on the MCP Kotlin SDK. The source folder (`src/main/kotlin`) will contain a `Main.kt` with a `fun main()` launching the server. It might use Ktor or Spring Boot along with the MCP Java/Kotlin SDK to handle routes.  
  - **Rust:** Initializes a Cargo project (`Cargo.toml`) possibly including an MCP Rust crate (if available) or uses a web framework like Actix or Warp to set up endpoints. The `src/main.rs` will start an HTTP server that serves the defined routes, integrating any available MCP support.  

During code generation, the tool also ensures that any naming conflicts or invalid identifiers are handled. For example, if an OpenAPI path `/users/{id}` yields a Python method name `get_user_id`, or a GraphQL field `latest-news` (with a hyphen) is converted to a valid function name (like `latest_news`). This makes the output code immediately compilable/runable in the target language.

### 3. Security & Privacy Enforcement  
One of the distinguishing features of this generator is automatic integration of security and privacy best practices into the generated server:  

- **Privacy Filters:** If configured, the tool inserts code to perform data minimization and redaction on responses. *Data minimization* means the server will only return the fields necessary to fulfill the request, avoiding exposure of extra data ([Data Minimization in Web APIs - W3C](https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/APIMinimization#:~:text=Data%20Minimization%20in%20Web%20APIs,required%20to%20offer%20a%20service)). This could be implemented by filtering out unspecified fields from objects before sending a response. *Field redaction* means completely removing or masking sensitive information ([Best Logging Practices for Safeguarding Sensitive Data | Better Stack Community](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/sensitive-data/#:~:text=Redacting%20involves%20the%20complete%20hiding,specific%20purposes%20or%20authorized%20individuals)). For instance, if the config specifies `redact_fields: ["password"]`, the generated code will include a response post-processing step (perhaps in a middleware function) that sets any `password` field to `"REDACTED"` before output. This ensures sensitive data is not accidentally leaked. By redacting data, the information is permanently eliminated from outputs, preventing unauthorized access to sensitive info ([Best Logging Practices for Safeguarding Sensitive Data | Better Stack Community](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/logging/sensitive-data/#:~:text=Redacting%20involves%20the%20complete%20hiding,specific%20purposes%20or%20authorized%20individuals)). Anonymization (if enabled) could be handled similarly by stripping or hashing personal identifiers in responses or logs. These privacy measures are implemented in a **privacy middleware** module that the main server code uses. The middleware is clearly documented, so developers can adjust the logic if needed (for example, updating the list of fields or the anonymization technique).  
- **Secure Headers:** The generated server includes middleware to set HTTP security headers on every response if `secure_headers` is true. For example, it may add `Content-Security-Policy`, `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, and `Strict-Transport-Security` headers with recommended values. This protects the server against common web vulnerabilities by default. In the Python output, this might be a simple function that wraps responses; in Node/Express, it could use a package like `helmet` to add headers; in Kotlin or Rust, corresponding library calls ensure these headers are set.  
- **Rate Limiting:** If `rate_limit` is enabled, the tool generates a rate-limiting mechanism appropriate to the language. Typically, this might involve an in-memory token bucket or leaky bucket algorithm to cap the number of requests per minute. For example, in Python the code could integrate a library like `ratelimit` or implement a simple counter in an asynchronous loop; in Node, use `express-rate-limit`; in Kotlin, perhaps use a filter with a sliding window counter; in Rust, employ middleware from frameworks or a crate like `tower` to enforce limits. The configuration might allow adjusting the rate (e.g. 100 requests/minute by default). The rate-limiting middleware will reject or delay requests that exceed the threshold, returning an HTTP 429 status.  
- **Compliance Settings:** If the config specifies a compliance mode (like `"GDPR"`), the generated code will include notes or structures to facilitate compliance. For instance, it might include a section in the README about data handling practices, and in code, ensure there's an easy way to delete or anonymize user data. It could also integrate logging and auditing features if required by compliance. While full compliance often requires organizational processes, the code aims to make technical compliance easier (for example, making sure personal data can be easily purged, and that logs don't store personal identifiers beyond a retention period).  

All these security/privacy features are optional based on the config, and the tool ensures they are **opt-in/opt-out**. The inserted code is well-commented, explaining what it does and referencing relevant standards. This not only gives a secure starting point but also educates the user (e.g. a comment might read: "`# Rate limiter: limits to 100 requests/min to prevent abuse (configurable)`"). The use of middleware for these concerns keeps the core logic clean and separates security from business logic.

### 4. Authentication Middleware  
Authentication is another critical piece. The tool generates an **authentication middleware** according to the specified method, which is then integrated into the server request handling pipeline. This makes sure that incoming requests (or connections, in the case of MCP) are validated:  

- **OAuth 2.0:** If OAuth 2.0 is selected, the tool scaffolds an OAuth2 flow. It might include placeholders for validating JWT access tokens or calling an OAuth introspection endpoint. For example, in Python it could use the `authlib` or `fastapi` OAuth2 utilities, or simply parse the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header and leave a `# TODO: verify token` in place. In the generated middleware code (say `auth_middleware.py`), there would be a function that checks the request for a valid token. If the token is missing or invalid, it returns an HTTP 401/403 response immediately. If valid, it attaches the user/principal info to the request context for use in endpoints. The code is structured to allow customization—e.g., a function `validate_token(token: str) -> bool` is provided for the user to implement actual verification (such as checking signature and claims, or querying an OAuth server), and it's called by the middleware.  
- **API Keys:** If API key auth is selected, the tool generates middleware that looks for an API key in either the headers (commonly `X-API-Key`) or query parameters, as specified. The config might allow an `apiKeyHeader` name or a list of valid keys for development. The middleware then checks incoming requests: if a valid key is present, the request proceeds; if not, it returns 401 Unauthorized. Similar to OAuth, the logic for verifying the key (e.g. checking against a list or database) is left as a hook that the user can extend.  
- **Integration in Server Code:** The main server startup code ensures that the authentication middleware is the first to run on each request. For instance, in an Express (TypeScript) server, the generated code will have `app.use(authMiddleware);` at the top, and in a Python server using, say, FastAPI or a custom framework, the middleware would be added via decorators or wrapped around the request handler. This means unauthorized requests are blocked before hitting any resource logic.  
- **Manual Extension Points:** The generated code is careful to mark where developers can plug in their own logic. For example, for OAuth, it might have a block: 
  ```python
  # TODO: Replace this simple token check with actual OAuth2 validation logic.
  if not validate_token(token):
      return Response("Unauthorized", status=401)
  ``` 
  And `validate_token` could be a stub function. This makes it easy for a developer to integrate with their user database or third-party auth provider. The README will also mention that manual steps are needed to fully implement authentication (e.g. registering your OAuth client, obtaining keys, etc.).  

By providing a working skeleton of authentication, the tool saves time on boilerplate (e.g. setting the correct headers, response codes, structure of middleware), while leaving flexibility for custom requirements.

### 5. Project Output Structure  
Finally, the tool writes out a structured project directory containing all the generated files. The output is organized for clarity and follows standard conventions of the chosen language. After generation, the user can open this directory and find everything needed to further develop and run the MCP server. Below is an example structure for a Python output (other languages are analogous with equivalent file types):

```plaintext
my-mcp-server/  
├── README.md                       # Instructions for setup and usage  
├── requirements.txt                # Python dependencies (e.g. modelcontextprotocol SDK)  
├── server.py                       # Main server code (entry point for the MCP server)  
├── auth_middleware.py              # Authentication middleware logic  
├── privacy_middleware.py           # Privacy-related data redaction/anonymization logic  
├── security_middleware.py          # Security middleware (rate limiting, headers)  
└── utils/                          # (Optional) Utility modules (e.g., helpers, data models)  
    └── types.py                    # Data model classes or types from the spec (if any)  
```  

- In **Python**, as shown above, the output includes a single-file server implementation (`server.py`) for simplicity, and separate modules for middleware. If the project is larger, this could be organized into a package with an `__main__.py` to allow installation and running via `python -m my_server`. The `requirements.txt` will pin the latest stable MCP Python SDK and any other library used. We also include a `README.md` explaining how to set up a virtual environment, install the requirements, and run the server (e.g. `python server.py` or `uvicorn server:app` if using an ASGI framework). The README can also remind the user of any post-generation steps (like filling in auth details or implementing stubbed functions). This structure follows typical Python project layouts, making it easy to understand and extend ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,start%20building%20an%20MCP%20server)).  
- In **TypeScript**, the structure would include a `package.json` (with dependencies like `"@modelcontextprotocol/sdk"` for MCP, perhaps `"express"` and security middleware packages), a `tsconfig.json`, and a source directory `src/` with the server code. For example: `src/server.ts` (which sets up the Express app or the MCP SDK server) and files like `authMiddleware.ts`, etc. There might also be a sample `.env.example` file if API keys or secrets are needed. The README will have instructions to run `npm install`, then `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation) and `npm start` to launch the server.  
- In **Kotlin**, the tool might produce a Gradle project. The structure could be: `build.gradle.kts` (including the MCP Kotlin SDK dependency), `src/main/kotlin/com/example/mcp/Server.kt` containing the main function and server setup, and possibly `src/main/resources/application.conf` if using Ktor. The README will include instructions to run the project (e.g. `./gradlew run`) and where to configure OAuth credentials or API keys.  
- In **Rust**, the output would be a Cargo project folder with `Cargo.toml` (listing dependencies such as an MCP crate or web frameworks like Rocket/Actix) and `src/main.rs`. The main file would set up an HTTP server and define routes corresponding to the spec (using macros or manual routing). Comments in the code would indicate where to implement logic. The README might instruct how to `cargo run` the project and any additional setup needed (SSL certificates if needed for secure headers, etc.).  

Every generated project includes a **README.md** that serves as documentation for the user. It explains how to install dependencies, how to run or build the server, and describes the project structure. It also highlights that the project was generated by this tool and lists any next steps (for example, “Fill in your database credentials in `server.py`” or “Implement the TODO sections in auth_middleware.ts for OAuth2 verification”). The README can even reference Anthropic's MCP documentation for further reading on how to customize or use the server. This ensures that a developer new to MCP can easily continue from the generated template.

The output is intentionally kept clean and minimal. Unnecessary files are avoided, and the layout is consistent. As noted in Anthropic’s philosophy, the generator follows a “batteries included” approach while sticking to best practices ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,start%20building%20an%20MCP%20server)) – meaning the project comes ready with everything needed to run, but without clutter or excessive configuration. For instance, the Python project might use standard packaging but not include complex sample code beyond what the spec requires.

## Additional Considerations  

**Error Handling:** The CLI tool itself has robust error handling for its inputs and operations. It will catch common issues like file not found, JSON/YAML syntax errors, unsupported spec features, or inability to write output files. Errors are reported with actionable messages. Internally, the code uses exceptions and validation checks liberally – for example, if the JSON config is missing a required field (like `"language"`), the tool will print a message and exit rather than generating a broken project. This prevents time wasted on debugging the generated output by ensuring the generation preconditions are correct.  

**Modularity and Maintainability:** The implementation is organized into modular components, making it maintainable and extensible: the spec parsing logic, code generation for each language, and middleware generation are separated into different classes or functions. This means if a new output language or a new security feature needs to be added later, it can be done in isolation. For instance, adding support for a new language (say, Go) would involve creating a new generator module for Go, without altering the core parser. The use of templates and configuration-driven logic also helps maintainability, as changes to the base templates (e.g. updating to a new MCP SDK version) propagate to all generated projects easily. The code is liberally commented to explain each step, which is useful both for developers using the tool and for those looking to modify/improve it.  

**Compliance with MCP Documentation:** Throughout the generated code, we align with the patterns recommended in Anthropic's MCP documentation. This includes using the official SDKs correctly, structuring the server to register resources and start listening in the expected way, and including any necessary configuration for the Claude AI integration. By using the SDK, the generator inherently respects the protocol specification and ensures the servers are compatible with clients like Claude ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,SDK%20for%20the%20server%20project)). Moreover, we looked at example servers and templates provided by Anthropic (such as their create-mcp-server templates) to mirror their best practices. For example, the Python project follows standard packaging and includes the minimal files required to run, reflecting the "Zero Configuration" and best practices approach from Anthropic ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,start%20building%20an%20MCP%20server)).  

**Documentation in Code:** The generated code comes with documentation comments. Each function or class has a brief docstring explaining its purpose (often derived from the API spec descriptions). Important sections of code (like the top of `server.py` or `Server.kt`) include a comment that this file was auto-generated and pointers to documentation or next steps. We also ensure the code is formatted (e.g., using a linter/formatter for the respective language) so that the user receives a clean, ready-to-edit codebase.

With these considerations in mind, let's look at how the implementation is structured in code.

## Implementation Outline  

Below is an outline of the Python CLI tool's implementation, broken into components for clarity. This code demonstrates how the tool would be constructed to meet the requirements above.

### Spec Parser Module (`spec_parser.py`)  
This module handles reading the API spec file and converting it into a normalized internal representation. We define a simple data class for endpoints and a parser class:  

```python
import os, json, yaml
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Dict, Any

@dataclass
class EndpointSpec:
    """Data structure for a single API endpoint or GraphQL field."""
    name: str            # Name of the operation (function name safe)
    path: str            # URL path or GraphQL field name
    method: str = None   # HTTP method (GET/POST) for REST, or None for GraphQL
    input: Dict[str, Any] = None    # Input schema or params
    output: Dict[str, Any] = None   # Output schema or return type
    description: str = ""          # Description or documentation string

class SpecParser:
    def detect_spec_type(self, file_path: str) -> str:
        """Detects whether the spec file is OpenAPI or GraphQL based on content or extension."""
        ext = os.path.splitext(file_path)[1].lower()
        if ext in {".yaml", ".yml", ".json"}:
            # Peek into file content for OpenAPI keys
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                head = f.read(1000)  # read first 1000 chars
            if "openapi" in head or "swagger" in head:
                return "openapi"
        if ext == ".graphql" or ext == ".gql":
            return "graphql"
        # Fallback: simple heuristic
        with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
            content = f.read()
            if "openapi" in content:
                return "openapi"
            if "type Query" in content or "schema {" in content:
                return "graphql"
        raise ValueError("Could not determine specification type (OpenAPI or GraphQL).")
    
    def parse(self, file_path: str) -> List[EndpointSpec]:
        """Parse the spec file into a list of EndpointSpec objects."""
        spec_type = self.detect_spec_type(file_path)
        endpoints: List[EndpointSpec] = []
        if spec_type == "openapi":
            # Load YAML/JSON OpenAPI spec
            with open(file_path, 'r') as f:
                if file_path.endswith((".yaml", ".yml")):
                    spec = yaml.safe_load(f)
                else:
                    spec = json.load(f)
            # Traverse paths and methods
            paths = spec.get("paths", {})
            for path, methods in paths.items():
                for method, operation in methods.items():
                    name = operation.get("operationId")
                    if not name:
                        # create a function name from method and path
                        # e.g., GET /users/{id} -> get_user_by_id
                        clean_path = path.strip("/").replace("{", "").replace("}", "")
                        parts = clean_path.split("/") if clean_path else []
                        if parts:
                            func_name = "_".join([method.lower()] + parts)
                        else:
                            func_name = method.lower() + "_root"
                        name = func_name.replace("-", "_")
                    # Gather info
                    desc = operation.get("description", "") or operation.get("summary", "")
                    # For simplicity, just grab parameter names and response schema type (if any)
                    params = {}
                    for param in operation.get("parameters", []):
                        params[param["name"]] = param.get("schema", {}).get("type", "Any")
                    # Note: requestBody and responses could be parsed for detailed schemas
                    output = None

In this code, `EndpointSpec` is a dataclass capturing the relevant info for each API operation. The `SpecParser` handles both OpenAPI and GraphQL. We use Python’s `yaml.safe_load` for OpenAPI YAML files and a regex for GraphQL SDL as a simple approach (in a real implementation, a dedicated GraphQL parser would be used for accuracy). Key points: we generate a safe function name if `operationId` is missing by combining method and path, strip braces from path parameters, and replace hyphens with underscores. We also collect parameter types (as an illustration) and a very basic notion of output type. This will allow the code generator to, for instance, create function definitions with the right parameters.

Error handling is demonstrated by raising `ValueError` if the type detection fails or if an unsupported spec is encountered. These exceptions can be caught in the CLI entry point to display user-friendly messages.

### Code Generator Module (`codegen.py`)  
This module takes the list of `EndpointSpec` objects and the configuration, and produces the project files. It is organized by target language for clarity. Each language gets its own generation function, and a dispatcher decides which one to use.

# MCP Server Project

This project was generated by the MCP CLI tool. It contains a skeleton MCP server in **Python** using Anthropic's Model Context Protocol SDK.

## Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:  
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```  

2. **Configure**: Update `auth_middleware.py` with valid credentials or token verification logic as needed. Adjust `privacy_middleware.py` to refine which fields to redact or include.

3. **Run the server**:  
   ```bash
   python server.py
   ```  
   (By default, this uses the MCP Python SDK to start the server. Ensure you have access to the data sources the server will connect to.)

## Project Structure

- **server.py**: Main server code, defines the MCP server class and endpoints.  
- **auth_middleware.py**: Handles authentication (API Key or OAuth2) for incoming requests.  
- **privacy_middleware.py**: Implements data privacy rules (field redaction, anonymization, etc.).  
- **security_middleware.py**: Sets security headers and includes a placeholder for rate limiting logic.  
- **requirements.txt**: Python dependencies for the project (includes the MCP SDK).  

## Next Steps

- Implement the logic inside each endpoint handler in `server.py` (marked with TODOs) to connect to your data sources or perform actions as described by the API spec.
- For OAuth2, integrate with your identity provider by replacing the token validation stub in `auth_middleware.py`.
- Test the server with the MCP Inspector or by connecting it to a Claude instance to ensure it responds with the expected data.
- Refer to Anthropic's MCP documentation for advanced usage and to understand how clients will interact with this server.

```  

In the `CodeGenerator`, we use Jinja2 templates and f-strings to compose the output files. The `_generate_python_project` creates a virtual environment friendly structure with separate Python modules for each concern (auth, privacy, security). It uses the configuration to conditionally include code: for example, it only adds rate limiting setup if `security.rate_limit` is true. We illustrate this with a Jinja2 template where we check `security_rate_limit` to maybe include a rate limiter structure. The middleware functions are written as plain strings for simplicity, but these could also be generated via templates. They contain `TODO` comments where the developer should fill in logic (like actual API key or token validation). 

For TypeScript, we programmatically build a simple Express-based server in `server.ts`. We include the MCP SDK (`createServer` import) – in a real scenario, the SDK might provide its own server or router, but here we integrate with Express for familiarity. Security middleware `helmet` and `express-rate-limit` are used based on config. Auth is handled with simple `app.use` middleware checks. Each OpenAPI endpoint becomes an Express route (`app.get/post/...`) with a placeholder response. GraphQL endpoints would normally require setting up an Apollo Server or similar, but since this is a generator, we leave a TODO comment for GraphQL implementation if needed. The `package.json` and `tsconfig.json` are generated to make the project buildable immediately.

Kotlin generation shows a basic Gradle setup with a dependency on an MCP SDK (assuming one exists) and a `main` function. We keep it minimal, as a full implementation would depend on the specifics of the SDK's usage. The idea is that the developer will fill in the details, possibly using the SDK to define routes/resources.

Rust generation initializes a Cargo project and uses the Warp framework for demonstration. It sets up a simple server that currently just responds with a hello message, and includes comments where each endpoint from the spec should be implemented. If an official MCP Rust SDK emerges, the generator can be updated to use that, but using Warp/Axum ensures the server is functional as a normal web service in the meantime.

Each `_generate_<language>_project` function also writes a very basic README specific to that language, and prints a confirmation message to the console. We use Python’s file I/O (`open().write(...)`) to create files; for binary or more complex outputs, we could ensure proper encoding but since these are text files it’s straightforward.

### CLI Entrypoint (`main.py`)  
This is the script that ties everything together. It parses command-line arguments, reads the input files, invokes the parser and generator, and handles any errors gracefully:  

```python
import argparse
import sys
from spec_parser import SpecParser
from codegen import CodeGenerator

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Generate an MCP server from an OpenAPI or GraphQL specification.")
    parser.add_argument("spec_file", help="Path to the API specification file (OpenAPI YAML/JSON or GraphQL schema).")
    parser.add_argument("config_file", help="Path to the JSON configuration file.")
    parser.add_argument("-o", "--output", help="Output directory for the generated server project (default: ./output)", default="./output")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    # Load configuration
    try:
        with open(args.config_file, 'r') as cf:
            import json
            config = json.load(cf)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: Unable to read configuration file. Details: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Parse the spec file
    spec_parser = SpecParser()
    try:
        endpoints = spec_parser.parse(args.spec_file)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error: Failed to parse spec file. {str(e)}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Determine output language from config
    lang = config.get("language")
    if not lang:
        print("Error: 'language' not specified in configuration.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    if lang.lower() not in {"python", "typescript", "kotlin", "rust"}:
        print(f"Error: Unsupported output language '{lang}'. Choose from Python, TypeScript, Kotlin, Rust.", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)

    # Generate the project
    try:
        generator = CodeGenerator(lang, config)
        generator.generate_project(endpoints, args.output)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error during code generation: {e}", file=sys.stderr)
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        print(f"✅ MCP server project successfully generated in '{args.output}' for language {lang}.")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```  

This CLI uses Python’s `argparse` for parsing command-line arguments, expecting the spec file and config file as positional arguments. It then reads the config (exiting with an error if the file is missing or not valid JSON). Next, it parses the spec file to get the list of endpoints. We handle exceptions from `SpecParser.parse` to give a user-friendly error. After that, we ensure the `language` field is present in config and is one of the supported options, otherwise we print an error message. Then we instantiate `CodeGenerator` with the chosen language and config, and call `generate_project`. Any errors in generation (for example, file write permissions issues or an unanticipated condition) are caught and reported. If everything goes well, we print a success message with a checkmark.

This modular design (with separate `spec_parser.py` and `codegen.py`) makes the code easier to test and extend. For instance, one could add unit tests for `SpecParser` to ensure it correctly parses various OpenAPI/GraphQL examples. The use of f-strings and templates in `CodeGenerator` results in readable code in the output files, and since we included the key configurations in the generation logic, the output server already has the intended security and privacy features wired in.

### Best Practices and Final Notes  
The generated projects are immediately usable as a starting point for an MCP server. By following the structure and patterns provided by Anthropic's official tools and documentation, we ensure the output is not only functional but also maintainable in the long run. For example, using the official SDK in each language means future updates to MCP can be adopted by upgrading the SDK version, rather than changing custom protocol code ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,SDK%20for%20the%20server%20project)). The project structure and code organization mirror standard conventions (e.g., separating concerns into modules, providing a clear entry point), which aligns with the philosophy of having **zero configuration and batteries-included** while following community best practices ([GitHub - modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server: Create a Python MCP server](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/create-python-server#:~:text=,start%20building%20an%20MCP%20server)).

With comprehensive documentation (both in the README and inline in code), a developer can quickly understand how to secure the server and hook it up to real data sources. This CLI tool thereby accelerates the development of MCP servers, letting developers focus on implementing the core logic of their data integration while the boilerplate for security, authentication, and compliance is handled automatically.
